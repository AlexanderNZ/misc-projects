    <h1>Blog API</h1>
    <h3>This code is not currently being worked on.</h3>
    <h3>A basic Blog Backend Java API</h3>
    <p>This project was completed for a University assignment. It's the first serious bit of java I've written for
      university since Compsci 230, which I took nearly 2 years ago. I really enjoyed this project.</p>

    <p>It's a RESTful service built on JAXRS and JAXB with Jersey and Maven. I used annotations rather than data
      transfer objects because I found it made for more readable code and less overall complexity.</p>

    <p>It comes as the first part of a two part series of assignments for CS335, the submission I've just made involved
      writing a front end that integrated with a remote book and bluray shop API. Once submissions for that close,
      I might connect these two peices up and make a basic blog implementation.</p>

    <p>Would that be completely unnecessary? God yes. For my actual blogging needs I use Jekyll (<3 Jekyll) -
      but it would be pretty sweet to be able to point people to a working (albeit basic) blog that I wrote myself.</p>
