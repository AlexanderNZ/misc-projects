    <h1>Enroller</h1>
    <h3>I'm probably not going to be super active maintaining Enroller</h3>
    <h3>A Java program to help enrol people in things.</h3>
    <p>it's a small program that I wrote to make my life easier. I had a job to set about 40-60 developers up with
      some password management software. Rather than send all of them to Ops one by one to enter their details
      (wasting Dev time and Ops time) - and rather than having to take all of their details myself
      (wasting my time and theirs), I came up with a simple Swing GUI that would collect the relevant details, and send those off to a google form.</p>

    <p>That google form piped the input off to a sheet that Ops has access to. It has benefits:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I don't need to waste time sifting through emails, pulling out data and structuring it.</li>
      <li>I don't need to know the passwords these guys want to register against the service - the program hashes the password in RAM and doesn't store state.</li>
      <li>With the roll out of this program, it'll be easier for new developers to be enrolled in things when they
        start working - the same details (except passwords) can be reused - simply change the endpoint you're hitting
        and be automagically enrolled in Bitbucket, JIRA, anything you want.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I'm sure there are other advantages (and drawbacks) that I haven't considered too. At any rate it was an interesting days work to get it all going!</p>

    <p>I've run it through Sonar Qube and it has zero issues (as at 19 October 15) - so that bodes well for the quality
      of the code I've written. Except for the lack of tests, I'm really trusting users not to wreck it since it's in
      their interests not to! Perhaps I should harden it a bit. Time will tell.</p>
