    <h1>Angular Bookshop</h1>
    <h3>This code is not currently being worked on.</h3>
    <h3>This is an angular front end for a bookshop application</h3>
    <p>This project was completed for a University assignment. It's a simple front end that has a number of security
    vulnerabilities. We used this assignment to have a play with things like XSS and CSRF in a front end, defensive context.</p>

    <p>We were provided with a vulnerable back end service for the second half of the assignment, and we had to figure out
    how to break it in various different ways. This is the first introduction I had in to practical security work.</p>

    <p>While I enjoyed this security work, and while I think it's a really important thing for every developer to be aware of,
    I just can't bring myself to feel about it as passionately as I feel about other aspects of software development.</p>
